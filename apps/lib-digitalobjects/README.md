# Lib-Digitalobjects

This folder contains AWS resources needed for the deployment of the Lib-Digitalobjects (formerly referred to as DIPOnline) folder for IASC

### What's created?:
* An S3 bucket for storing static web files
* An AWS Cloudfront CDN for this S3 Bucket

### Additional Info:
* This is using manually imported certificates to ACM that were generated by MIT (InCommon)
* Files are uploaded to the S3 Bucket manually.
* Eventually this bucket should be attached to Archivematica which will manage the file upload process.
* This will allow static content to be displayed on libraries.mit.edu when it migrates to a cloud provider.
