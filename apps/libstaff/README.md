## Libstaff Archive

*Note: This is only created in our Terraform `prod` workspace*

This app is used to create an S3 hosted website for the old libstaff.mit.edu content. The old libstaff server has been shutdown, and a backup copy of the content has been uploaded to the `libstaff-archive.mitlib.net` S3 bucket. A majority of this content is static HTML and accessible via the web by visiting http://libstaff-archive.mitlib.net (*Restricted to VPN*).

If content is unviewable or inaccessible by visiting the link above, you may download files directly from the AWS GUI or via the command line using the AWS CLI.
